# NASA-RUL-ASSIGNMENT
This assignment focuses on predictive maintenance by predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines using both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). Main_rul.ipynb is where all the code and necessary librairies are for the assignment. In order to access the data I recommend going to [NASA Open Data Portal]( https://data.nasa.gov/Aerospace/CMAPSS-Jet-Engine-Simulated-Data/ff5v-kuh6/about_data) or following the kaggle prompt in the python file. I will also upload the data I used in this repository if you want to download it directy from here. I ran this on jupyter notebook, but colab can also work. I used a starter notebook provider by my instructor for this assignment. I also utilized ChatGPT and have attached two appendicies of chatGPT conversations. In theses documents it will not show the screenshots I took, but the responses are still there. There are hundreds of prompts as I use ChatGPT for the whole assignment to learn and understand what is happening.
